    <p>
      The game begins with a grid of cells, each of which is concealed.
      Some of the cells contain mines.
      The goal of the game is to determine all cells that are not mines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left-clicking on a cell reveals it.
      If it is a mine, the game is over.
      Otherwise, it is labeled with a number indicating
       the number of its neighboring cells that are mines.
      (No label indicates zero neighboring mines.)
      Revealing a cell with no neighboring mines will reveal its neighboring cells.
    </p>
    <p>
      To aid your deduction process,
      you can mark cells you believe to be mines by right-cliking them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: Currently, the cells have a 15% probability of being a mine.
